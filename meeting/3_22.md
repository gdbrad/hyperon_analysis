confirm that the following for xi system agree:

with same priors, ensure that model averages for extrap. masses are roughly equivalent 
list what plots we need and delegate coding for this

Can we close the loop on the scale setting correlation options? I dont really see why it would matter for physical unit fits..

what order in m_pi do we realistically need to go to for the fv corrections? Are the LO corrections sufficient?


maybe deal with error budget routine , how to properly compute the error coming from statistical parameters (I believe this is the culprit)
