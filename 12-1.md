## Updates from pseudo-meeting 

Based on the resulting model weights, including both fpi and phys fits, only a single fpi model contributes significantly to the model average. This model does not include light quark terms or xpt terms, deeming this a semi-useless model. 

Based on this result (to be confirmed by grant once his slow desktop completes), Nolan proposes that we discard Fpi fits from the analysis. This will in turn reduce the total uncertainty when we extrapolate the hyperon masses to the physical point. 

## Remaining to-dos

-  (Nolan) Study impact of a different definition of the isosymmetric physical point on scale setting
- (Grant,Nolan) compare results for physical fits before and after model averaging 


# To-do (long term)
- (Grant, Nolan) Work on plotting routine for $M_B$ vs $\epsilon_\pi^2$ (in physical units)
    - This will probably require fitting $F_\pi = F_\pi(\epsilon_\pi, \dots)$
- (Aaron, Amy, Andre, Grant, Nolan, Zack, ...) Gather missing data / bootstrap "best" choices for correlator fits
    - (Nolan) Produce alternate dataset using model-averaged results
- (Grant, Nolan) Make plots checking convergence of the xpt mass formulas (e.g., $M_{\Xi}^\text{NNLO}/M_{\Xi}^\text{LO}$ vs $\epsilon_\pi^2$)
    - Dimensionless $\implies$ Doesn't require fitting $F_\pi$
- (Andre) Calculate finite volume corrections

* ask zack for fpi fits ?
